# n8n Template Repo

This repository provides a collection of pre-built n8n workflows designed to help you quickly set up and automate common tasks. Whether you're new to n8n or an experienced user looking for quick starting points, these templates aim to streamline your automation efforts.

## What is n8n?

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a powerful open-source workflow automation tool. It allows you to connect various apps and services, automate tasks, and build custom workflows without needing to write extensive code. Think of it as a bridge between your favorite tools, enabling them to communicate and perform actions automatically.

## How to Use These Templates

There are a few ways to utilize the n8n templates provided in this repository:

### 1. Import Directly into n8n

The easiest way to use a template is to import its JSON file directly into your n8n instance.

1.  **Browse the `templates` directory:** Navigate to the `templates` folder in this repository.
2.  **Select your desired template:** Choose the `.json` file for the workflow you want to use.
3.  **Download the JSON file:** Click on the file, then click "Raw" to view the raw JSON, and save it to your computer (e.g., `my_workflow.json`).
4.  **Open your n8n instance:** Go to your n8n dashboard.
5.  **Import the workflow:**
    * Click the "New" button in the top left.
    * Select "Import from File" or drag and drop the downloaded JSON file into the n8n canvas.
6.  **Configure and activate:** Once imported, you'll need to configure any necessary credentials, API keys, or specific settings within the workflow nodes. After configuration, activate the workflow.

### 2. Copy and Paste JSON

You can also copy the raw JSON content and paste it into n8n.

1.  **Browse the `templates` directory:** Navigate to the `templates` folder.
2.  **Select your desired template:** Open the `.json` file.
3.  **Copy the raw JSON:** Click the "Raw" button and copy all the content.
4.  **Open your n8n instance:** Go to your n8n dashboard.
5.  **Create a new workflow:** Click "New".
6.  **Paste the JSON:**
    * Click on the canvas, then press `Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+V` (macOS).
    * Alternatively, go to "File" > "Import" > "From Clipboard".
7.  **Configure and activate:** Configure the workflow and activate it.

### 3. Use as a Reference

Even if you don't import them directly, these templates can serve as valuable references for building your own n8n workflows. Examine their structure, node configurations, and logic to learn best practices and discover new ways to approach automation challenges.
